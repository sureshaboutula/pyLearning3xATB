# Lambda Expression --> To do the task in One line
# This works when you have only one line in your code

# def double_my_salary(salary):
#     return salary * 2
#
# new_salary = double_my_salary(100000)
# print(new_salary)

function_double_my_salary = lambda salary:salary * 2
print(function_double_my_salary(100000))
