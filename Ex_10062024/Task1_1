# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

# "=" operator :
1. It is assignment operator
2. It is used to assign a value to variables

# "==" operator
1. It is comparison or relational or equality operator
2. It is used to check the equality or inequality of two values or variables
3. It returns boolean value - True or False


# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
1. It is Exponentiation operator
2. It does exponentiation
Eg: 2**5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 # 2 to the power of 5


# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
1. It performs bitwise XOR operation
2. It compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise it is set to 0 if both are 1 or both are 0
Eg: 6 ^ 3 = 0110 ^ 0011 = 0101 = 5
